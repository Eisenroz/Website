       I chose this font because of it's fun and unique look. I wanted the website to look like I am trying to sell the font thats why I used a lot of free stock images and slap my personal designs on to them. The over all design elements of the website is using a jpeg as a background image within a contianer. These background images are designed to look like cow prints. Each section of cow print is a location of where the designer is from. THe first section being St. Charles, the next being Missouri, and the last being USA. As I mentioned before, this website is designed to look like I am selling the designer's font and want to showcase every single thing about the font, like its transparency, the look, the different typefaces, and some testable colors or colors that I thought would look great on this font.
